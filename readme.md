# dev-setup

`dev-setup` is a Node.js command-line interface (CLI) that automates the creation of predefined folder structures for both frontend and backend applications. Inspired by the simplicity of `create-react-app`, this tool provides a fast-track setup for developers, allowing them to start with their favorite tools and configurations in place.

## Features

- **React**: Set up a new React project configured with TypeScript.
- **Nest**: Initialize a new NestJS backend application with optimal defaults.

`dev-setup` ensures that you can start developing immediately without the repetitive setup tasks, integrating best practices and essential tools out-of-the-box.

## Installation

You can install `dev-setup` globally on your system using the npm package manager:

```bash
npm install -g dev-setup
```

## Usage

To create a new project, simply run one of the following commands in your terminal:

- For a React with TypeScript project:

  ```bash
  dev-setup react
  ```

- For a NestJS project:

  ```bash
  dev-setup nest
  ```

This will generate a new folder in your current directory containing all the necessary files and folders based on the template chosen.
